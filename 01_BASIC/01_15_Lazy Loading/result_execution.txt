The image is not loading
ChatGPT
To troubleshoot the issue with the image not loading, please ensure the following:

Check Image Path: Verify that the src prop passed to the LazyLoadingImage component points to the correct image URL. Ensure that the path is correct relative to the location of the image file.

Network Connection: Ensure that your device has an active internet connection. If the image is hosted online, make sure the server hosting the image is accessible.

Image Availability: Confirm that the image file exists at the specified URL. You can try opening the image URL directly in your browser to see if it loads.

Console Errors: Check the browser console for any error messages related to the image loading process. These errors can provide valuable information about what might be causing the issue.

Permissions: If the image is hosted on a server, ensure that the server permissions allow access to the image file. Sometimes, server configurations may restrict access to certain files.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): If the image is hosted on a different domain, ensure that the server hosting the image allows cross-origin requests. CORS policies can sometimes block requests to load images from different domains.
