To write simple unit tests for React components using Jest, you can follow these steps:

Install Jest and React Testing Library: First, you need to install Jest and React Testing Library if you haven't already:
bash

Copy code
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom --force

Write Test Cases: Create test files for your components with the .test.js or .spec.js extension. In each test file, import the component you want to test along with the necessary testing utilities from React Testing Library.

Write Test Cases: Write test cases to verify the behavior of your components. You can simulate user interactions, check if certain elements are rendered, and verify that the component behaves correctly under different conditions.

Run Tests: Run the tests using Jest to ensure that your components are working as expected.
